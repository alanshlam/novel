 ## Introduction for Chapter 1
  Trapped behind enemy lines, Air Force cadet Sean Walker expects a bullet, not mercy. When he comes
  face-to-face with a lone enemy diplomat, he offers his life for his students. But her decision will shatter
  his understanding of the war and ignite a connection that defies allegiance.

## Introduction for Chapter 2
  A routine patrol turns into a race against time when newly-commissioned pilot Sean Walker discovers the
  diplomat who once saved him is now flying into a death trap. With radio silence enforced and enemy guns on
  him, his only way to warn her is to risk everything in a breathtaking maneuver that will either save her
  life or kill them both.

  阱。在無線電靜默與敵方炮火的雙重威脅下，他唯一能警告她的方法，就是賭上一切，執行一項驚心動魄的飛行特技——其結
  果若非拯救她的生命，便是兩人同歸於盡。
