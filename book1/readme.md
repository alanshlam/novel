## Introduction for Chapter 2
A routine patrol turns into a race against time when newly-commissioned pilot Sean Walker discovers the diplomat who once saved him is now flying into a death trap.

In a high-stakes gambit, Ruby Vance risks treason to expose a conspiracy. From a neutral nation, she initiates a clandestine digital rendezvous with Sean Walker, entrusting him with explosive intelligence that could topple her government's plans but cost her everything.
