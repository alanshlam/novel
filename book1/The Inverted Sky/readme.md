# The Inverted Sky

## Main Characters

### Ruby Vance (The Meridian Federation <img src=../image/mf_flag.png width="40"> )

<img src=../image/ruby.png width="100"> **Archetype:** The Idealist in a Cynical World

Born into a dynasty of diplomats, Ruby was groomed from birth to navigate the intricate dance of international politics. On the surface, she is the perfect envoy: impeccably educated, fiercely intelligent, and possessing a tough, analytical mind that can dissect any political problem. Her appearance —- short blonde hair and sharp, tailored suits—projects an aura of no-nonsense capability.

Beneath this polished exterior, however, lies a deep-seated conflict. She sees the fervent patriotism preached by her leaders for what it is—a convenient shelter for greed and ambition. This has caused her to grow weary of her own country's relentless warmongering, leaving her caught between a nominal duty to her nation and the urgent pull of her conscience. This has fostered a profound, well-guarded empathy for the people caught in the crossfire of conflicts she is sent to manage. While her influence is limited, she skillfully uses every tool at her disposal—her intellect, her family name, and her sheer force of will—to mitigate damage and protect lives, all while wrestling with the moral compromises her position demands.

### Sean Walker (The Caspian Combine <img src=../image/cc_flag.png width="40">)
<img src=../image/sean.png width="100"> **Archetype:** The Survivor with a Conscience

Sean is a product of the harsh realities of his world. Sent to a military academy at a young age not for glory but for survival, he learned early on that institutions are often corrupt and that authority is not to be trusted. His intelligence is not academic but adaptive and razor-sharp, honed by years of observing and navigating the "dirty politics" and injustices of a system designed to break men like him.

He carries himself with a lean, watchful intensity, his eyes holding the weary look of someone who has seen too much. He views the nationalistic propaganda that fuels the war with a profound cynicism, recognizing it as a tool the authorities use to manipulate the populace and justify their actions. Sean is a master at playing the game; he understands the rules of the powerful and knows how to bend them to survive. However, this cynicism is at constant war with a stubborn, unyielding conscience. He despises the system he is a part of and refuses to become one of the predators he sees in positions of power. His graduation to Second Lieutenant is not a triumph, but a deeper entanglement in a life he never chose, forcing him to constantly seek a path where he can be effective without sacrificing his soul.

## Chapter 1: Acquaintance

A thousand years from now, the world had forgotten peace. For a decade, nations bled under the iron fist of perpetual war, their conflicts fueled by the insatiable hunger for resources and the toxic pride of global dominance. In this broken world, Sean, a young man forged in poverty, was on the cusp of graduating from the air force academy. His final test was not in the cockpit of a fighter jet, but on the ground, as a mentor leading a group of junior students on a field training exercise.

Their return home was a descent into chaos. An unexpected Meridian Federation offensive had swallowed the land, turning their path into a war zone. Now, they were rats in a maze of rubble, hiding in the shell of a shattered building, the enemy's pursuit a constant, looming threat.

Ruby, a diplomat from the Meridian Federation, was also a prisoner of this sudden violence. Born to wealth and privilege, she was on her way home from a diplomatic mission aimed at forging fragile alliances. An armed, professional escort team was her shield, but in the maelstrom of the offensive, the shield had broken. Separated from her protectors, she stumbled into the same ruined building where Sean and his students were hiding.

The sight that greeted her was a tableau of fear and defiance: a young officer and a handful of cadets, their uniforms marking them as the enemy.

Outside, the shouts of her escort team echoed through the ruins, drawing closer. Sean heard them too. He was outmanned, outgunned, and trapped. He looked at the diplomat, his mind racing. He made a choice.

"You can turn me in," he said, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands. "But let them go. They're just kids, not soldiers yet."

Sean and Ruby locked eyes, a silent battle of wills raging in the space between them. He saw a flicker of something in her gaze – not hatred, but a weary sorrow. She, in turn, saw not a monster, but a young man prepared to sacrifice everything for the lives of others. The tension was a physical thing, a heavy weight in the dust-filled air.

As the footsteps of her team grew louder, just outside their hiding place, a sigh escaped Ruby's lips. "Tell your students to find another career," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "This meaningless war isn't worth the price of their lives."

She turned and walked away, melting back into the shadows from which she had emerged. A moment later, Sean heard her voice, clear and strong, calling out to her team, leading them away from the building.

In the silence that followed, Sean let out a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding. He didn't know her name, but he knew he owed her his life, and the lives of his students. In the depths of his heart, a silent "thank you" was offered to the enemy who had shown him mercy. With a newfound resolve, he gathered his students, and together, they navigated the treacherous path back to their own lines, the memory of the mysterious diplomat burned into his mind.

## Chapter 2: Reunion

Months later, the title of Second Lieutenant was fresh on Sean’s collar. He was no longer a cadet but an official pilot, the cockpit of his fighter a second skin. The endless sky was a welcome escape from the politics on the ground. One day, a routine patrol near the border was shattered by a priority alert: a suspicious, unidentified aircraft attempting a clandestine border run.

Following protocol, Sean located the craft, a sleek private transport half-hidden by the dense forest canopy below. Duty demanded he report it immediately. But something held him back—a gut feeling, a memory. He deployed a micro-drone, its stealth optics feeding a silent stream of data to his console. As the image resolved, his breath caught in his throat. In the passenger seat of the enemy craft was Ruby.

The sight of her—the woman who had saved him and his students—sent a jolt through him. His duty was clear, but the memory of her quiet act of mercy was clearer. His subconscious didn't just suggest a course of action; it screamed it. He killed the uplink to headquarters. For now, this was his secret. He would follow her, a ghost in the sky, and understand her purpose.

His surveillance revealed a desperate, suicidal flight plan. Ruby's transport was heading for the "Dead Man's Corridor", a narrow passage infamous for its overlapping fields of anti-air batteries. Without a valid, friendly authorization code, her plane would be shredded by automated defenses long before it reached the border.

There was no time. Under the blanket of total radio silence enforced in the zone, he had no way to warn her. No way but one.

He pushed his engines, closing the distance. Her crew, seeing a hostile fighter approaching at speed, armed their weapons. Alarms lit up Sean's console. He ignored them. He activated his plane's external flashlight, aiming it at her cockpit and began to flash a frantic message in Morse code.

DANGER AHEAD. TURN BACK.

The response was a warning shot that streaked past his canopy. He held his course, his own plane's alarms screaming. He flashed again, this time adding a personal plea.

REMEMBER YOUR ADVICE. TO MY STUDENTS. TRUST ME.

Inside Ruby’s transport, confusion turned to shock. Her pilot was shouting about the madman in the fighter jet. But Ruby saw the flashes, understood the message. *Your advice to my students.* There was only one person it could be. With her heart pounding, she made a choice born of faith. "Do not fire!" she commanded her crew. "Let him approach."

Sean flew impossibly close, the wingtips of their aircraft nearly touching. He began broadcasting his own plane's authorization code on a wide, powerful frequency, hoping the signal was strong enough to envelop her transport in a protective bubble. To the automated defense systems, they had to appear as one.

"I'm declaring a technical emergency," he reported to his own headquarters, his voice a mask of calm professionalism. "Flight controls are unstable. Maintaining altitude to diagnose."

Then came the maneuver—a feat of impossible airmanship. He inverted his fighter, flying upside down directly above her transport, extending his variable-geometry wings to their maximum width. The goal was to merge their two radar signatures into a single, larger blip that matched his friendly code. The strain on his body and his aircraft was immense. The controls screamed in his hands, every muscle straining to hold the formation steady.

For a breathtaking moment, as their planes flew in perfect, terrifying unison, they locked eyes through their respective canopies. He saw the fear and astonishment on her face, but also a profound, silent gratitude. She saw the raw concentration and determination etched on his.

Finally, they left the "Dead Man's Corridor". The last threat icon vanished from his screen. He peeled away, his jet rolling upright as he broke the formation. Ruby's transport was safe, a clean vector to the border. As her plane sped away, she pressed a hand to the cold glass of the window, her heart aching with a silent thank you, and a question that would haunt her: in a world without war, who could they have been to each other?
