# The Inverted Sky

## Main Characters

### Ruby Vance (The Meridian Federation <img src=../image/mf_flag.png width="40"> )

<img src=../image/ruby.png width="100"> **Archetype:** The Idealist in a Cynical World

Born into a dynasty of diplomats, Ruby was groomed from birth to navigate the intricate dance of international politics. On the surface, she is the perfect envoy: impeccably educated, fiercely intelligent, and possessing a tough, analytical mind that can dissect any political problem. Her appearance —- short blonde hair and sharp, tailored suits—projects an aura of no-nonsense capability.

Beneath this polished exterior, however, lies a deep-seated conflict. She sees the fervent patriotism preached by her leaders for what it is—a convenient shelter for greed and ambition. This has caused her to grow weary of her own country's relentless warmongering, leaving her caught between a nominal duty to her nation and the urgent pull of her conscience. This has fostered a profound, well-guarded empathy for the people caught in the crossfire of conflicts she is sent to manage. While her influence is limited, she skillfully uses every tool at her disposal—her intellect, her family name, and her sheer force of will—to mitigate damage and protect lives, all while wrestling with the moral compromises her position demands.

### Sean Walker (The Caspian Combine <img src=../image/cc_flag.png width="40">)
<img src=../image/sean.png width="100"> **Archetype:** The Survivor with a Conscience

Sean is a product of the harsh realities of his world. Sent to a military academy at a young age not for glory but for survival, he learned early on that institutions are often corrupt and that authority is not to be trusted. His intelligence is not academic but adaptive and razor-sharp, honed by years of observing and navigating the "dirty politics" and injustices of a system designed to break men like him.

He carries himself with a lean, watchful intensity, his eyes holding the weary look of someone who has seen too much. He views the nationalistic propaganda that fuels the war with a profound cynicism, recognizing it as a tool the authorities use to manipulate the populace and justify their actions. Sean is a master at playing the game; he understands the rules of the powerful and knows how to bend them to survive. However, this cynicism is at constant war with a stubborn, unyielding conscience. He despises the system he is a part of and refuses to become one of the predators he sees in positions of power. His graduation to Second Lieutenant is not a triumph, but a deeper entanglement in a life he never chose, forcing him to constantly seek a path where he can be effective without sacrificing his soul.

## Chapter 1: Acquaintance

A thousand years from now, the world had forgotten peace. For a decade, nations bled under the iron fist of perpetual war, their conflicts fueled by the insatiable hunger for resources and the toxic pride of global dominance. In this broken world, Sean, a young man forged in poverty, was on the cusp of graduating from the air force academy. His final test was not in the cockpit of a fighter jet, but on the ground, as a mentor leading a group of junior students on a field training exercise.

Their return home was a descent into chaos. An unexpected Meridian Federation offensive had swallowed the land, turning their path into a war zone. Now, they were rats in a maze of rubble, hiding in the shell of a shattered building in the Blue Lake district, the enemy's pursuit a constant, looming threat.

Ruby, a diplomat from the Meridian Federation, was also a prisoner of this sudden violence. Born to wealth and privilege, she was on her way home from a diplomatic mission aimed at forging fragile alliances. An armed, professional escort team was her shield, but in the maelstrom of the offensive, the shield had broken. Separated from her protectors, she stumbled into the same ruined building where Sean and his students were hiding.

The sight that greeted her was a tableau of fear and defiance: a young officer and a handful of cadets, their uniforms marking them as the enemy.

Outside, the shouts of her escort team echoed through the ruins, drawing closer. Sean heard them too. He was outmanned, outgunned, and trapped. He looked at the diplomat, his mind racing. He made a choice.

"You can turn me in," he said, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands. "But let them go. They're just kids, not soldiers yet."

Sean and Ruby locked eyes, a silent battle of wills raging in the space between them. He saw a flicker of something in her gaze – not hatred, but a weary sorrow. She, in turn, saw not a monster, but a young man prepared to sacrifice everything for the lives of others. The tension was a physical thing, a heavy weight in the dust-filled air.

As the footsteps of her team grew louder, just outside their hiding place, a sigh escaped Ruby's lips. "Tell your students to find another career," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "This meaningless war isn't worth the price of their lives."

She turned and walked away, melting back into the shadows from which she had emerged. A moment later, Sean heard her voice, clear and strong, calling out to her team, leading them away from the building.

In the silence that followed, Sean let out a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding. He didn't know her name, but he knew he owed her his life, and the lives of his students. In the depths of his heart, a silent "thank you" was offered to the enemy who had shown him mercy. With a newfound resolve, he gathered his students, and together, they navigated the treacherous path back to their own lines, the memory of the mysterious diplomat burned into his mind.

## Chapter 2: Reunion

Months later, the title of Second Lieutenant was fresh on Sean’s collar. He was no longer a cadet but an official pilot, the cockpit of his fighter a second skin. The endless sky was a welcome escape from the politics on the ground. One day, a routine patrol near the border was shattered by a priority alert: a suspicious, unidentified aircraft attempting a clandestine border run.

Following protocol, Sean located the craft, a sleek private transport half-hidden by the dense forest canopy below. Duty demanded he report it immediately. But something held him back—a gut feeling, a memory. He deployed a micro-drone, its stealth optics feeding a silent stream of data to his console. As the image resolved, his breath caught in his throat. In the passenger seat of the enemy craft was Ruby.

The sight of her—the woman who had saved him and his students—sent a jolt through him. His duty was clear, but the memory of her quiet act of mercy was clearer. His subconscious didn't just suggest a course of action; it screamed it. He killed the uplink to headquarters. For now, this was his secret. He would follow her, a ghost in the sky, and understand her purpose.

His surveillance revealed a desperate, suicidal flight plan. Ruby's transport was heading for the "Dead Man's Corridor", a narrow passage infamous for its overlapping fields of anti-air batteries. Without a valid, friendly authorization code, her plane would be shredded by automated defenses long before it reached the border.

There was no time. Under the blanket of total radio silence enforced in the zone, he had no way to warn her. No way but one.

He pushed his engines, closing the distance. Her crew, seeing a hostile fighter approaching at speed, armed their weapons. Alarms lit up Sean's console. He ignored them. He activated his plane's external flashlight, aiming it at her cockpit and began to flash a frantic message in Morse code.

DANGER AHEAD. TURN BACK.

The response was a warning shot that streaked past his canopy. He held his course, his own plane's alarms screaming. He flashed again, this time adding a personal plea.

REMEMBER YOUR ADVICE. TO MY STUDENTS. TRUST ME.

Inside Ruby’s transport, confusion turned to shock. Her pilot was shouting about the madman in the fighter jet. But Ruby saw the flashes, understood the message. *Your advice to my students.* There was only one person it could be. With her heart pounding, she made a choice born of faith. "Do not fire!" she commanded her crew. "Let him approach."

Sean flew impossibly close, the wingtips of their aircraft nearly touching. He began broadcasting his own plane's authorization code on a wide, powerful frequency, hoping the signal was strong enough to envelop her transport in a protective bubble. To the automated defense systems, they had to appear as one.

"I'm declaring a technical emergency," he reported to his own headquarters, his voice a mask of calm professionalism. "Flight controls are unstable. Maintaining altitude to diagnose."

Then came the maneuver—a feat of impossible airmanship. He inverted his fighter, flying upside down directly above her transport, extending his variable-geometry wings to their maximum width. The goal was to merge their two radar signatures into a single, larger blip that matched his friendly code. The strain on his body and his aircraft was immense. The controls screamed in his hands, every muscle straining to hold the formation steady.

For a breathtaking moment, as their planes flew in perfect, terrifying unison, they locked eyes through their respective canopies. He saw the fear and astonishment on her face, but also a profound, silent gratitude. She saw the raw concentration and determination etched on his.

Finally, they left the "Dead Man's Corridor". The last threat icon vanished from his screen. He peeled away, his jet rolling upright as he broke the formation. Ruby's transport was safe, a clean vector to the border. As her plane sped away, she pressed a hand to the cold glass of the window, her heart aching with a silent thank you, and a question that would haunt her: in a world without war, who could they have been to each other?

# Chapter 3: The Devil's Bargain

Upon her return to the Meridian Federation's capital, Ruby stood before the Ministry of State's debriefing council. The room was sterile, the faces of the officials impassive. When they asked about the unidentified fighter that had shadowed her through the Dead Man's Corridor, she delivered the lie she had rehearsed a hundred times.

"The pilot signaled his intent to defect," she stated, her voice a mask of calm professionalism. "He escorted us to the border, but lost his nerve at the last moment and turned back." The lie tasted like ash, but it was the only shield she could offer the man who had saved her life.

The council moved on. The true purpose of her mission had been to assess the viability of an alliance with a brutal warlord faction known as the Scourge of Kassian, who were fighting to overthrow the Caspian Combine's government. In her report, Ruby was unequivocal. She detailed the Scourge's atrocities—massacres, human trafficking, genocide—with cold, factual precision. Her official recommendation was stark: "Alliance with this group is fundamentally against the strategic and moral interests of the Meridian Federation. They are not liberators; they are bandits and war criminals."

A week later, she was summoned to the office of Undersecretary Thorne. He didn't ask her to sit.

"Your report was... thorough," Thorne began, his voice smooth as polished stone. "However, the Ministry has decided to proceed with the alliance." He slid a data slate across his desk. "Intelligence confirms the Scourge has deeply infiltrated the Combine's command structure. Their chances of success are high."

Ruby stared at him, incredulous. "Sir, their 'command structure' is a network of thugs. Did you read the addendum on their human rights record?"

"I did," Thorne said, his eyes cold. "And you will now prepare the necessary materials to sanitize it. Press releases, a Q&A for the conference, the presentation for the Senate hearing, and the official line for the media. The hearing is next week. The Senate's endorsement is a formality, after which we will begin funneling weapons and funds. You have one week."

The room tilted. The air grew thin. During her mission, she had seen what the Scourge did to their enemies. She had walked through a village where every man, woman, and child had been slaughtered to make an example. She had heard the stories of their rape gangs. "How?" she whispered, the question hanging in the air. "How can our government help those... monsters... get into power?"

"That is not your concern," Thorne replied, his tone final. "Your concern is the narrative. Your claim that their infiltration is a bluff has been noted and dismissed. This is the final decision."

For two days, Ruby sat in her office, the blank screen of the press release mocking her. Every time she tried to write a sentence—*A new era of partnership... A courageous step towards freedom...*—her mind was flooded with the faces of the Scourge's victims. The words choked her.

Then the whispers began. They slithered through the Ministry's halls, dripping with ambition. *Ruby Vance is cracking under the pressure. She's unfit for the job. She's about to be replaced.* She knew the sharks were circling, colleagues who coveted her position and would gladly write the lies she could not. The pressure was a physical weight, a crushing force on her chest that made it hard to breathe.

Late one night, alone in the silent expanse of her office, she saw her reflection in the dark window overlooking the city lights. She looked tired. Defeated. She raised a hand, touching the cold glass as if to steady the trembling image staring back at her.

"Will I become a monster," she whispered to her reflection, "to help another monster harm the innocent?"

She blinked, and a single, hot tear broke free, tracing a path down her cheek. It was not a tear of sadness, but of terrifying clarity. The system wasn't asking for her expertise. It was demanding her soul.

# Chapter 4: The Gambit

Ruby did not sleep. She remained in her office, a ghost in the silent ministry as the city slept. When the morning light streamed in and her colleagues returned, a cold resolve had settled over her. She would give Thorne exactly what he wanted.

She became a whirlwind of chilling efficiency. She drafted the press conference materials, transforming the Scourge of Kassian from butchers into valiant freedom fighters. She called key senators, using her political acumen to probe their positions and tailor the hearing presentation to their vanities and fears. She worked around the clock, her fingers flying across the console.

By Friday, it was done. She placed a data slate on Undersecretary Thorne’s desk. It was a masterpiece of propaganda: a flawless press release portraying the warlord as a saviour, a hearing presentation arguing the alliance as a moral imperative, and a powerful speech for the Minister of State justifying the flow of weapons as an act of justice.

Thorne was visibly impressed. "Exceptional work, Vance. I knew you had it in you."

"Thank you, sir," Ruby said, her voice carefully modulated to sound weary. "The assignment was draining. I'd like to request a short leave for the weekend. A trip to the Republic of Cygnus for some refreshment. I'll be back Monday to see this through."

"Granted," Thorne said, pleased with his subordinate's apparent dedication. "You've earned it."

That evening, Ruby boarded a transport to Cygnus, a neutral nation famous for its luxurious resorts. She carried only a small bag, but inside it was an encrypted data scrambler—a piece of contraband tech that was her only hope.

She checked into a hotel under a fake name and a forged ID. In the political neutrality of Cygnus, communication with the Caspian Combine was unrestricted. She navigated to a propaganda forum for the Combine's air force, a place filled with jingoistic pilots and fans. Using an attractive profile picture and a new persona, she began to fish. After a few posts asking innocent, fawning questions, she set the hook. In a public thread, she asked: "Hypothetical question for the pilots here: why would anyone use Morse code in a heavy air defense area during an emergency?"

The question, specific and odd, was just enough. Soon, a private message appeared in her inbox for a private chat. It was from Sean. His first thought was: *Is this a trap?* But the fear that Ruby might be in danger overrode his caution.

**Sean:** In an emergency, you use a designated distress frequency. Morse code is obsolete.

**Ruby:** What if the goal wasn't to call for help, but to appear as a single radar signature? By, for example, flying inverted directly above another plane?

**Sean:** ...What plane?

**Ruby:** ...

**Sean:** A TF35 transport?

**Ruby:** ...

**Sean:** ...From the Meridian Federation?

**Ruby:** Do you still remember my advice?

**Sean:** ...

**Ruby:** In the Blue Lake district.

A thrill of cold electricity shot down Sean's spine. It was her.

**Ruby:** Follow this link. The password is the first two words of my advice. All lowercase, no spaces.

Sean immediately terminated the chat, his heart pounding. He switched to a secure terminal, routing his connection through a dozen anonymizing proxies before accessing the dark web link. He entered the password: `findanother`. The chat window opened.

**Sean:** I remember proposing to surrender in the ruins of the city hall. Are you in danger?

**Ruby:** No. But your nation is. I am sending you a package. First-hand, unedited intelligence. Images, videos. My private collection, shared with no one. You will leak it—anonymously—to an anti-government news outlet in my country called The Clarion. The leak must appear to come from a mole within the Scourge itself. Once you see the files, you'll understand.

**Sean:** What are the risks?

**Ruby:** For you? If caught, you're a whistleblower, a national hero. For me, it's treason. I'm trusting you not to disclose the source. Proceed with care.

Sean downloaded the files. The raw, brutal truth of the Scourge's atrocities flooded his screen. The rumors were true. He felt a surge of cold fury, followed by a wave of profound admiration for the woman on the other side of the screen.

**Sean:** I'll make it look like it came from the warlord's inner circle. How do I contact you again?

**Ruby:** The less we communicate, the safer we are. I will find you if needed. You can track my status through official Federation media... if I'm still there. Take care. Ruby Vance, out.

*Ruby Vance.* The name hit him like a physical blow. He knew of the Vance dynasty. He never imagined it could produce someone like her.

On Monday, Ruby was back at her desk, a model of professionalism. She pretended to be busy preparing contingency plans for the hearing, while her heart hammered against her ribs in anxious anticipation. On Tuesday morning, The Clarion broke the story. The headline was explosive: "FEDERATION'S NEW ALLIES: HEROES OR BUTCHERS?"

The story went viral. The unedited images and videos were undeniable, sparking international outrage. Ruby, feigning crisis-management mode, presented her "contingency plan" to Thorne. "The leak appears to be internal to the Scourge," she said with professional gravity. "The data corresponds to intel one of their lieutenants would possess. Our cover-up attempts are only making it worse."

By evening, public opinion had turned into a landslide of condemnation. Under immense pressure, the Ministry of State officially suspended the alliance and cancelled the hearing. Ruby allowed a flicker of disappointment to cross her face in front of Thorne, but inside, she felt the purest, most profound relief of her life.

Days later, Sean tried the dark web link again. It was dead. The forum account was deleted. He scanned the Federation news, but couldn't find any mention of Ruby. When he hacked into the Ministry's public directory, her name was still there, a small but significant relief. Follow-up reports on The Clarion detailed the aftermath: the leak had exposed the Scourge's key positions, forcing them into a full retreat and allowing for the rescue of hundreds of captives. Ruby's brave act had saved thousands of lives.

*Ruby Vance.* The name was now etched in his mind. Her bravery and unwavering determination to uphold her conscience in the face of treason deeply impressed his heart. He looked out at the sky, wondering what the world could be if more people in power were like her—willing to risk everything for what was right.

## Chapter 5: Looting

President-Marshal Corvus promised his people a swift and glorious victory. The invasion of Erden was meant to last a month. It had now bled for more than a year.

It began as a desperate gambit by President-Marshal Lysander Corvus of Sirona. For fifteen years, his dictatorship had been propped up by the military might of the Meridian Federation, a force he used to crush any internal dissent. But with the voices of uprising growing louder in his own streets, Corvus needed a distraction—a glorious, unifying war. He turned his eyes to his neighbor, the Republic of Erden, and launched an invasion under the false pretext of liberating the Sironan-speaking people who lived there.

He expected a quick victory. He underestimated the people of Erden.

Under the leadership of their democratically elected President, Kaelen Rask, the people of Erden fought with a ferocity Corvus could not comprehend. They knew what they were fighting for. President Rask had forged a strategic, if fragile, alliance with the Caspian Combine, hoping their military power could act as a shield. The Combine, for its part, saw Erden as a potential buffer state against the Meridian Federation and agreed to provide limited support, though their true aim was to install a more compliant puppet government.

Now, a year of brutal attrition had pushed both nations to the brink of collapse. The rot was deeper in Sirona, where the "quick victory" had become a bloody quagmire. The propaganda posters rang hollow. Across the nation, the "Don't Send Our Sons to the Grave" movement gained traction, with decorated veterans joining the protests. To save his regime, Corvus decided to stake everything on one last, decisive blow, convinced he held a hidden trump card that would finally win him the war.


As part of the Combine’s newly endorsed troop deployment, Sean Walker found his wings clipped. Reassigned from his fighter squadron, he was now attached to a ground support company, tasked with piloting transport craft and providing close air support for the push to defend Erden’s capital, Aethelgard.

His commanding officer was Captain Eric Voss, a man who was a perfect product of the Combine's bureaucracy: utterly incapable in any practical sense. Sean watched him, a knot of dread in his stomach. Two days ago, Voss, utterly lost and misreading his own command console, had nearly marched the entire company into a Sironan minefield. Only a frantic, screaming old farmer, running from his steading, had saved them.

Without the people of Erden, their company would have been a line of smoking craters before they ever saw the capital. The locals gave the Combine soldiers everything they had—a loaf of precious bread, a cup of clean water, a whispered warning about an enemy patrol. Sean saw the hope in their tired, desperate eyes. They looked at the soldiers of the Caspian Combine not as cynical allies, but as saviors. They were counting on this reinforcement to help them defeat the invaders, a faith Sean feared was tragically misplaced.

By the time Sean’s company reached the outskirts of Aethelgard, the city was already a skeleton. Sirona’s relentless air raids had shattered its defenses, leaving it exposed and vulnerable. Key infrastructure lay in ruins, and the sky was a permanent, bruised grey from the smoke of a hundred fires. The remnants of the Erden army had been forced back into a few fortified government buildings, isolated pockets of defiance in a dying city.

The radio channels were a chaotic flood of desperation. Mayday calls from the besieged Erden units painted a grim picture: ammunition was nearly gone, fuel was exhausted, and food was a memory. They couldn't hold out much longer. Every plea for reinforcement was met with the same infuriatingly calm, automated reply from the Combine's central command: "Counter-offensive deploying... stand by."

Sean knew some Combine companies were fighting, engaging the Sironan advance with courage, but it was a drop in the ocean. It wasn't enough. With every passing minute, his heart hammered against his ribs. He monitored the collapsing Erden front lines, reporting their status to Captain Voss with an urgency that bordered on insubordination. The situation was spiraling from desperate to catastrophic.

"Sir, I have three drones armed and ready," Sean urged, his voice tight. "We can provide immediate air support for the presidential palace defenders. They're about to be overrun."

From the command vehicle, Voss's voice crackled back, devoid of any emotion. "Negative, Lieutenant. Hold your position. We are awaiting confirmation."

"Awaiting confirmation of what?" Sean whispered to himself, his knuckles white on the console. "People are dying right now."

Then, the world dissolved into silent, impossible white.

A flash, brighter than a sun, bleached the landscape, erasing shadows and searing itself onto the back of Sean's eyes. Even through the armored viewport, the intensity was blinding. A moment later, the shockwave hit—a physical blow, a ripple of force that shook their vehicles.

It was a neutron bomb.

Panic erupted. The disciplined order of the Combine forces shattered. Eric Voss’s voice, for the first time, was sharp with terror: "Pull back! All units, pull back to a safe distance! Now!"

In the chaotic retreat, a storm of questions ripped through the communication channels, a mixture of horror and disbelief.

*Who fired?*
*Was it a last, desperate act from the defenders of Erden—a final, suicidal "kamikaze" strike?*
*Or was it Corvus's trump card—a deadly warning from Sirona to the Caspian Combine?*
*And the most terrifying question of all: where did the bomb come from? The Federation? Or their own side?*

The unspoken fear hung heavy in the air, a silent scream that echoed louder than the blast itself: Had the proxy war just ended, and a nuclear war between the superpowers just begun?

For hours, Captain Voss stared at the radiation readouts on the surveillance console, his face pale and beaded with sweat. Finally, he straightened up, a mask of professionalism sliding back into place. "Radiation levels are within acceptable limits. We're moving in."

Sean was already out of his seat. "I'll call the medics and prep the rescue gear," he said, his mind racing. "There could be survivors in the shelters, deep in the basements."

"We're going to the basements," Voss replied coldly, his eyes avoiding Sean's. "But we're not taking medics. We're taking the Corps of Engineers."

The order made no sense, but it was an order. Voss led a detachment through the eerie, ash-covered streets to the ruins of the old Parliament building. In the cavernous basement, amidst the rubble, the engineers set up their equipment and began a controlled demolition, not of a collapsed wall, but of a solid, reinforced section of the foundation.

After a series of muffled explosions, a heavy steel door was revealed, warped and buckled. They forced it open. It was a vault. Inside, gleaming in the beams of their flashlights, were the treasures of Erden: stacks of precious metals, priceless jewels, and historical artifacts that chronicled a thousand years of their history.

Voss stepped inside, a greedy glint in his eyes as he began to calculate, his lips moving silently. He was estimating how much he could carry.

Confusion pricked at Sean. "Did President Rask authorize this?" he asked.

Voss ignored him.

"Does *our* command authorize this?" Sean pressed, his voice rising.

The Captain was too busy stuffing a priceless golden chalice into his field pack to respond. Other officers and soldiers were now pushing into the vault, their discipline dissolving into a frenzied scramble for loot.

"Is this our mission?" Sean finally roared, his patience shattering. "To *loot* the people we were sent to save?"

Voss finally looked up, his face a sneer of contempt. "Shut up, Lieutenant. Or you won't get a damn share."

Just then, another captain shoved Sean aside. "Out of the way, fly-boy," he snarled, before joining Voss in the plunder. Sean stood frozen at the entrance, watching in disgust as soldiers of the Caspian Combine, men whose lives had been saved by the people of Erden just days ago, now scavenged through the heritage of their saviors like jackals on a carcass. It was one of the ugliest things he had ever witnessed. *Do they even have souls?* he wondered.

"Sir!" A private's panicked voice cut through the greedy clamor. "Sironan armor and infantry approaching! Closing fast!"

Voss, his pack now bulging, barked at Sean. "Hold the line, Lieutenant! Take a fire team and stop them!"

It was a suicide order. They had brought no heavy anti-tank weapons. As Sean and a handful of privates took up defensive positions in the ruins, he saw his only chance. He still had a link to the drones he had armed earlier. With frantic precision, he called down a strike, guiding a missile into the command tank of the Sironan column. The explosion ripped through the street. The Sironan advance, unsure of how much air support the Combine had, faltered and temporarily fell back.

As Sean turned to head back to the vault, a familiar sound roared overhead. He looked up just in time to see his own transport helicopter—the one he was assigned to pilot—lifting off and banking sharply away, leaving him behind.

He sprinted back to the Parliament building. The vault was empty. The basement was deserted. The soldiers, the officers, Captain Voss—all of them were gone. The treasure of Erden was gone.

He keyed his comms unit, his hands shaking with rage, but he didn't waste time hailing Voss. He scanned for the frequencies of other Combine companies in the area, any unit that wasn't part of Voss's looting operation. "This is Lieutenant Walker of ground support company Delta," he broadcasted. "My unit has deserted its post. I am here with a fire team, behind enemy lines. Does anyone read?"

Only static answered. He tried every channel he could find. Nothing.

The horrifying realization hit him like a physical blow. This wasn't just Voss's company. It was a coordinated withdrawal. He hadn't just been abandoned by his captain; he'd been cut off by the entire operation. Left for dead.

One of the young privates with him, his face pale with terror, looked at Sean. "Sir? What do we do now?"
