# Chapter 9: Suicide Mission 

Sean made it back to the Caspian Combine. His return was quiet, his debriefing clinical. He submitted his official report, a masterpiece of truth, omission, and carefully constructed lies designed to protect his men and bury the conspirators. He knew Voss had likely vanished the moment he'd secured his stolen pension from the vault, but the official record needed to be cleaner.

**CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET – EYES ONLY**

**TO:** Office of the Inspector General, Combine Expeditionary Forces
**FROM:** 2nd Lt. Sean Walker, SO-GSD
**SUBJECT:** After-Action Report: Loss of Command, Detachment 7, Aethelgard, Erden

1.  **SITUATION:** Following the unsanctioned nuclear detonation in Aethelgard, Detachment 7 was ordered by Captain Eric Voss to enter the blast zone to secure the Parliament building. Captain Voss stated he had received credible intelligence that Erden forces had cached large quantities of Federation-supplied gold bullion in the Parliament vault as an emergency war reserve.

2.  **ACTION:** Captain Voss deemed this a time-critical intelligence and salvage opportunity. He ordered the entire platoon, including the undersigned, to breach the vault. Upon entry, Captain Voss personally supervised the loading of an unmarked civilian hover-truck with an estimated 1.2 metric tons of gold bullion and hard currency.

3.  **COMMAND DECISION:** At 02:14 local time, Captain Voss informed the platoon that he would personally drive the truck to a pre-arranged Combine extraction point for ‘immediate repatriation of strategic assets’. He gave a direct and explicit order for all remaining personnel to continue the humanitarian cover mission with the civilian refugees until relieved.

4.  **LOSS OF CONTACT:** Captain Voss departed alone. Radio contact was lost within minutes due to lingering electromagnetic interference. No member of the platoon has seen or heard from Captain Voss since that moment. His current status is unknown.

5.  **SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS:** After it became clear Captain Voss was no longer in communication and had abandoned the unit, I assumed command. All subsequent actions, including the escort of 1,500 refugees to Northgate and the improvisation of the armored train escort, were carried out on my own initiative to preserve the lives of Combine soldiers and the civilian refugees.

6.  **ASSESSMENT:** We have no knowledge of Captain Voss’s current whereabouts. It is my professional assessment that he has either defected with the stolen assets or was intercepted and killed by Erden partisans.

Before they had crossed back into Combine territory, Sean had gathered the handful of privates who had survived with him. His message was quiet and direct.

"There are two versions of this story," he told them, his eyes meeting each of theirs. "In the first version, we report exactly what's in that document. We blame Voss for everything, we go home as heroes who saved 1,500 people, and this whole nightmare is over. In the second version, we tell the truth about what we saw other companies doing. Intelligence will bury us all for 'losing strategic assets' and for witnessing something we shouldn't have. They'll make us disappear. Choose wisely."

They all chose the same story. It was the truth from where they stood, and it kept them alive.

Sean attached one final, private addendum to the file, for the eyes of the Inspector General only: *“It is my recommendation that Captain Voss be declared Missing in Action, Presumed Defected with State Assets. Officially closing the matter prevents a significant propaganda victory for the Meridian Federation and avoids deep institutional embarrassment.”*

He knew the Combine’s leadership. They hated embarrassment more than they hated losing gold. And while they might not have believed every word of his story, it was clean, it was plausible, and it gave them an easy way out. The file was closed.
