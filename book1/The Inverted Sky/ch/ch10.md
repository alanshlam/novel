### Night 0 – Under the Bridge

The sky is a canvas of strobing searchlights. Sean drags himself into the dark, wet culvert beneath the shattered stone bridge, his left arm hanging useless at his side, shoulder dislocated from the impact. He tastes blood. At least two ribs are cracked, each breath a fresh agony. He sinks into the freezing river water, letting the numbness chase the edges of the pain, a desperate anchor to consciousness.

He is utterly, completely alone.

For the first time since the academy, the silence is absolute. No engine whine, no radio chatter, no familiar voices on the guard channel. Only the quiet slap of the river against stone and the distant, predatory *thump-thump-thump* of helicopter rotors hunting the crash site.

He presses his forehead to the slick, mossy concrete and lets the names come, a grim roll call in his mind.

Major Ivan Rostova. The Ox. Court-martialed for treason after reporting that the Combine’s neutron-bomb arsenal was producing 50% more warheads than declared.

Captain Eva Rostova. His sister. Career ended after she disobeyed a direct order to save a village of civilians from a Sironan battalion.

Fedor and Anya. The intel officers who proved Combine “humanitarian” convoys were smuggling arms, only to have their memos buried and their careers along with them.

The logistics chief who wouldn't sign off on 400 tons of fuel that vanished into a general’s private account.

The squadron commander who, when ordered to falsify a report to cover up friendly-fire deaths, stated calmly for the record: “I will not sign a lie that sends my own soldiers to their graves.”

Leo. His friend. Who knew too much and talked too much.

Every one of them, in their own way, had looked at the same rotten system Sean had spent his life navigating and said, quietly or loudly, *no*.

And now they are hooded, zip-tied, and being loaded into Federation black sites. All because someone in their own chain of command changed a set of coordinates. All because they were worth more to the Combine dead than alive.

Sean spits a mouthful of blood into the river, watching the dark swirl carry it away. The searing pain in his ribs is nothing compared to the sudden, vicious clarity that cuts through the fog of shock.

If he runs now, if he finds a way home and keeps his mouth shut, he becomes exactly what he has always despised: another cog in the machine. Another officer who lets good people disappear so the system can keep grinding.

He thinks of the cadets who owed their lives to Ruby’s mercy. He thinks of Lisa Aris’s refugees. He thinks of the broken agent sobbing on the floor of the train, crying, *“I never wanted to be a betrayer.”*

He is done being the man who survives by looking the other way.

He whispers the words into the darkness, a vow made not to a flag or a nation, but to eleven living, breathing human beings locked in enemy hands.

“I’m coming back for you.”

The promise feels ridiculous spoken aloud to the uncaring river, but it burns the cold out of his bones and forges the pain into purpose.

## We Are Still Human

### Meeting the Sironan refugees
Sean burned his flight suit in a shallow pit, the smell of melting polymers acrid in the clean forest air. He fashioned a makeshift poncho from a plastic tarp scavenged from his parachute. For eighteen hours, he moved like a phantom, hiding from the constant buzz of drones during the day and using the darkness as his cloak.

Finally, he crested a forested ridge roughly 120 kilometers inland. Below, in a ravine, a small campfire flickered. He heard voices. Cautiously, he moved closer and saw three Sironan families—two couples, an elderly grandmother, and four young children—huddled together, sharing what little warmth they had. They were refugees.

He took a deep breath, raised an empty hand, and stumbled into the edge of their firelight, forcing a Sironan accent he'd picked up from intelligence briefings. "Please," he pleaded, letting his exhaustion show. "I'm from Al-Rashid. I was with Corvus's guard. My unit... they shot us for refusing an order to burn a school."

The men were on their feet in an instant, their faces hard and suspicious. They frisked him roughly but found no weapons—he'd come down clean. They saw his dislocated shoulder, the deep bruises, the way he favored his ribs, and their vigilance slowly softened. He was not a threat; he was just another broken piece of the war.

Over the next hour, he shared a piece of himself, a carefully constructed fiction built on a foundation of truth. He "confessed" to fake atrocities he claimed to have witnessed, twisting the horrors he'd seen in Erden into a narrative of a disillusioned Sironan soldier. They bonded over their shared hatred of the warlords and the shattered state of their nation.

He offered his last two MREs and a multi-tool in exchange for clothes. The father gave him a torn but warm flannel shirt. A teenager gave him an oversized hoodie. As he changed, the grandmother, who had been a nurse before the war, approached him. With practiced, surprisingly strong hands, she reset his shoulder in one swift, agonizing movement, then fashioned a sling from a strip of cloth.

In return for his food, they gave him something far more valuable. He learned the specific dialect quirks of the Al-Rashid region for authenticity. He learned refugee slang—"warlord tax" for bribes, "rust-rot" for the Federation's automated patrols. He learned the safe routes, the patrol schedules on Highway 7 to avoid, and a crucial tip for the refugee district near the city of Dunfeld: they always needed laborers at the food warehouses, no questions asked. It was the perfect cover.

They invited him to join their journey, but he shook his head. "I'll slow you down," he said, gesturing to his arm. "You go on ahead. I'll follow the trails."

As they prepared to part ways, the old grandmother pressed a small, soft bundle into his hand. It was a child’s knitted scarf, the color of a clear sky.

“For when the nights get colder,” she said, her eyes kind. “Remember that we are still human, even when the world forgets.”

He wrapped the scarf around his neck. It felt like a promise.

---

That night, he sat on a fallen log under a sky full of unfamiliar Federation constellations. The scarf was a soft weight against his throat, a small point of warmth in the vast, cold wilderness.

He thought of every officer who had ever told him, "Orders are orders." He thought of Voss, loading gold while Aethelgard burned. Then he thought of Rostova's quiet defiance in a courtroom, Eva's roar of righteous fury over a village, and Leo’s sly grin that always hid a sharper truth.

They were the ones who refused. And now, there were eleven more, locked in Federation cells for refusing in their own ways.

He stood up, slung the scavenged pack over his good shoulder, and began the long walk northwest towards Dunfeld. He was no longer just surviving. He was hunting.

## The Ghost in the Machine

### The Birth of Samir Halabi

He stumbled into the Dunfeld refugee intake center looking like just another piece of human wreckage, speaking only broken Federation-standard with a thick, convincing Sironan accent.

The intake paperwork was a study in anonymity.

**Name:** Samir Halabi  
**Origin:** Al-Rashid district, former Sironan capital  
**Family:** Deceased. Corvus's final purges.  
**Skills:** "I fixed computers for a food warehouse before the war."  

The overworked, underpaid Federation relief officer barely glanced at him, stamped the form with a tired thud, and handed him a refugee meal card and a bunk assignment for Barracks 14-C. Just like that, Sean Walker ceased to exist. In his place was Samir Halabi, one of 27,000 displaced Sironans that nobody wanted to look at twice.

He spent the first week playing the part of a traumatized but useful survivor. He volunteered for every menial work-detail that got him outside the razor wire fence: cleaning rail sidings, unloading vegetable trucks, anything that let him observe patrol patterns and security protocols. In the evenings, he made a name for himself in the refugee canteen. For the price of a few cigarettes or an extra bowl of soup, he fixed broken data tablets and ancient point-of-sale terminals. Word spread fast through the barracks: "The new guy, Samir? He can make the machines work again."

His target was Klara Denkova, a stern, 63-year-old civilian logistics supervisor for NorthStar Services Ltd. NorthStar was the megacorporation holding the master contract for all food services on the sprawling Port Elara campus of the Federation Intelligence Agency (FIA). Twice a week, Klara came to the refugee center to recruit cheap, disposable day-laborers for the massive cold-chain warehouses that fed 42,000 FIA personnel.

Sean arranged to "fix" Klara's granddaughter's cracked study tablet. It bought him a five-minute conversation. He spun a simple, believable story, a tapestry of half-truths.

"I was an assistant inventory manager for the biggest wholesale produce terminal in Al-Rashid," he said, his voice laced with practiced sadness. "When Corvus fell, the mobs burned everything. I know every barcode system ever made—Inter-spec, Combine-standard, even old Meridian commercial codes. I can write inventory scripts in my sleep. I just want to work. Maybe send some money to my sister, if she's still alive."

It was the perfect bait. Klara was desperate. NorthStar was short twelve programmers after a recent purge of "security risks," and her deadlines were slipping. The pay was garbage, but the job came with a prize beyond measure: a Category C civilian contractor badge. A pass that got you on and off the FIA campus every single day.

He got the job offer the next morning.

**Job Title:** Junior Supply-Chain Data Technician (Grade 3 – Cafeteria Division)  
**Location:** NorthStar Services Warehouse 7B, Building 19, Port Elara FIA Campus Perimeter  
**Clearance:** Category C (Escorted access only; no classified areas)  
**Salary:** 1,100 credits/month + subsidized dorm bed  

He was in.

The NorthStar Services cafeteria logistics system was a relic. It was ancient, underfunded, and—in a spectacular display of bureaucratic oversight—physically shared the same backend servers as several "non-sensitive" FIA support functions: prisoner meal-planning databases, detention-center headcount manifests, and motor-pool fuel requisitions.

Sean's first week as "Samir" was a mind-numbing purgatory of reconciling lettuce deliveries and fixing faulty barcode scanners. He kept his head down, did his work efficiently, and garnered a reputation as the quiet, competent refugee who just wanted to be left alone.

On his ninth day, he found the skeleton key.

He was running a routine query for the daily prisoner meal-count report to cross-reference it with warehouse stock. He discovered that the two tables were not just related; they were generated by the same database instance. The table names were almost laughably literal: `PRISONER_FACILITY_HEADCOUNT` and `WAREHOUSE_INVENTORY_CURRENT`. Different schemas, same server. It was a security hole wide enough to fly a transport through.

He did nothing dramatic. He didn't hack a single thing. He simply started staying late, eating cold rations in the server room "to finish up inventory reports." While the bored night-shift guards watched football on their datapads, Sean meticulously and silently mapped the entire database schema. He traced connections, identified software vulnerabilities, and read years of archived, uncommented code left behind by lazy contractors.

No one noticed. No one ever noticed the quiet man in the oversized hoodie. But by the end of his second week, Samir Halabi, the refugee, had acquired:

*   A dorm bed six kilometers from the FIA's primary detention wing.
*   An electronic badge that let him ride the employee shuttle bus past the main guard posts twice a day, his face just another anonymous part of the daily shift change.
*   And a low-level logistics login that could, with a carefully crafted query, quietly pull tomorrow's prisoner transport schedule while appearing to order more tomatoes.

He was perfectly invisible, perfectly placed, and burning with the quiet, furious knowledge that eleven good soldiers were waiting for him somewhere inside the wire.

The first phase was complete. Now, he just had to wait for the perfect moment to slip through the digital cracks, penetrate the FIA's internal network, and begin planning the rescue.
